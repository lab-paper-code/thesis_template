\abstract{This paper provides an in-depth exploration of the interaction between quantum entanglement phenomena within quasiparticle neuromorphic architectures and non-deterministic logic gates. The core research objective is to develop a novel framework that minimizes the computational entropy of asynchronous data processing systems by utilizing stochastic resonance. We demonstrate that by leveraging a manifold of quasi-crystalline structures, it is possible to achieve a level of parallel processing unattainable in traditional von Neumann-based systems.
In particular, this study proposes a unique algorithm that combines a dynamic recurrent neural network with a Byzantine Fault Tolerance system for error control in topological quantum computers. This algorithm actively suppresses the decoherence of quantum states occurring in low-temperature environments and exponentially enhances system stability through a non-destructive measurement technique using ancillary qubits. The proposed hybrid architecture optimizes the information transmission latency between the classical control unit and the quantum processing unit, presenting a path toward the practical scalability of large-scale quantum computation.
